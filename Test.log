which I can't handle. Either drop the braces or make the material
unbreakable using an \mbox (\hbox). Note that a space
also counts as possible hyphenation point. See page 4 of the manual.
I'm leaving a black square so that you can see where I am right now.

For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that

your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

I came across hyphenatable material enclosed in group braces,
which I can't handle. Either drop the braces or make the material
unbreakable using an \mbox (\hbox). Note that a space

I came across hyphenatable material enclosed in group braces,
which I can't handle. Either drop the braces or make the material
unbreakable using an \mbox (\hbox). Note that a space
also counts as possible hyphenation point. See page 4 of the manual.
I'm leaving a black square so that you can see where I am right now.

misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,

A left brace was mandatory here, so I've put one in.
You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections
so that I will find a matching right brace soon.

I came across hyphenatable material enclosed in group braces,
which I can't handle. Either drop the braces or make the material
unbreakable using an \mbox (\hbox). Note that a space
also counts as possible hyphenation point. See page 4 of the manual.
I'm leaving a black square so that you can see where I am right now.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark

simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

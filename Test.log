you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the

I came across hyphenatable material enclosed in group braces,
which I can't handle. Either drop the braces or make the material
unbreakable using an \mbox (\hbox). Note that a space
also counts as possible hyphenation point. See page 4 of the manual.
I'm leaving a black square so that you can see where I am right now.

With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
